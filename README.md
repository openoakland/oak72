# About SafeGNV

**SafeGNV was derived from City72**. Visit SafeGNV at [safegnv.org](http://safegnv.org). For more information about the toolkit, visit [toolkit.sf72.org](http://toolkit.sf72.org). 

**Differences:**

• SafeGNV is set up so that all the text strings come from a locale file.

• SafeGNV is less reliant on a content management system (CMS). Instead, you would customize the site by editing image files and the locale file. This difference affords translation of the SafeGNV version, if desired.

• The Cloudinary add-on is not used on safeGNV. However, the add-on is still referenced in the code, in case you wish to enable the functionality. In other words, you do not need to pay for the premium add-on if you leave things as they are currently configured.

• City72 currently assumes that the site you are creating is for a city. Since all of the text on SafeGNV is editable, SafeGNV could more readily be adapted for a county or other community.

• SafeGNV requires a little more technical know-how but offers much more flexibility in terms customization and localization.

# Deploy on Heroku

Deploying to Heroku is the quickest way to launch an instance this site that you can adapt for your own community.

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/gnv-org/gnv#fork-destination-box). 

2. From your new GitHub repository, deploy to heroku:  

     [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

3. Name your app and give it a minute or two to deploy, you will then see a link to view it. If you don't have a Heroku account, you will be prompted to create one and verify your identity with a credit card. 

## Add-ons

The following free add-ons are automatically installed as part of set-up. Even though the add-ons are free, you have to verify your account by adding a credit card.

* **PostgreSQL** is the database for your application.
* **SendGrid** sends emails from your application (e.g. the forgot password email).
* **NewRelic** monitors your application performance

## Configure the recover password host redirection:

During setup, you will be prompted to enter a `EMAIL_REDIRECT_HOST`, used within the emails sent from your application. The value should be `YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com`

## Scale to 2 dynos

First, go to your Heroku account and create an application to be used for the project. When asked for the number of `web dynos` to be used in your application select `2`. There is a small monthly fee associated with having an extra dyno.

For testing purposes, you can choose an application with no extra dynos (this will be free). Please note that **sites with no extra dynos "go to sleep"** and can be slow to wake up. So, when you are ready to let the public use your site, make sure that your Heroku appliation has at least `2 dynos`. 
  
## FINAL STEP: Update your username and password via the Content Editor

Your site was installed with a default username and password (these are set in the db/seeds.rb file). Go to your app and login

`http://YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com/cms`

The default username and password are:

`admin@example.com`

`password`

Once you login, use the Admin menu in the navigation to change the email to your email address. Then you will need to change the password to a strong password that only you know.

# Development Environment Setup

In most cases you will not need to setup a development environment for this application. The only reason to go through the following steps would be if you wanted to customize your site beyond what you can set with the Content Editor.

## Prerequisites

To setup the application you will need:

* PostgreSQL database
* Ruby 1.9.3-p448
* Bundler gem
* Bower


### PostgreSQL installation

#### Linux

    $ sudo apt-get -y install postgresql

#### Mac OS X

    $ brew install postgresql

### Ruby Installation

#### Rbenv

To install ruby, it is necessary to have *rbenv* installed. This can be installed following the steps described in [rbenv's Github Repository](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), in the [Installation Section](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#installation).

#### Ruby 1.9.3-p448

When rbenv is already installed, go to the project's root folder, and run the following command

```sh
 $ rbenv install
```

### Bundler gem
In order the manage the project dependencies, it is necessary to have installed *bundler*.

```sh
 $ gem install bundler
```

### Bower
To manage the client-side js dependencies, it is necessary to have installed *bower*. *Bower* depends on *node.js*, so if it is not installed yet, install it with *nvm*, following these instructions: [NVM - Installation guide](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation).

Having *node.js* installed, run the following command to install *bower*:

```sh
npm install -g bower
```

## Development environment

Before running the app, the following steps should be performed.
* Obtain a copy of the application
* Create the database user for the application
* Install the application dependencies
* Create the database
* Download the client-side dependecies

### Obtain a copy of the application

Clone the code to your computer.
The command you type into your shell application (Terminal on the Mac) will be:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/city72/city-72.git
```

This will create a directory named `city-72`.

### Create the database user for the application

```sh
createuser -P -s city72
```
Assign the word *city72* as password too.

Linux users should run the above command as postgres user (`sudo su postgres`).

### Install the application dependencies

```sh
bundle install
```

### Create the database

```sh
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

### Download the client-side dependencies

```sh
bower install
```

## Run the application locally
With all the prerequisites and the development environment ready. Just run the app, with the following command:

```sh
bundle exec rails s
```

## Open your application on Port 3000

Go to your browser and open 

```sh
localhost:3000
```
